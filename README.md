# simulation
The purpose of this project is to get better at using class abstraction. I dont want the OO design to become too granular, but I also dont want to dump all the code in a single main.py. Other than this, it's fun to watch the dots behave in a controlled random environment.

# TODO
- Automatically evenly distribute node positions on screen and grid zones given number of nodes
- Diversify the node attitudes so each simulation iteration is unique, fun to watch, and results are unexpected
- Should node size change or should the zone sizes change? Or both should change with different scaling. Maybe there can be multiple win conditions (i.e. if only red nodes are left, then they win but if one team of nodes get their zone to cover the canvas then they win)
- Get the attitude based movement and actions into they're own class
